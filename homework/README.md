GWT User Interface
==================

GWT's Activity framework all wired up and ready to go
-----------------------------------------------------

The goal of this project is to provide a scaffolding for a GWT application based on the "Activity" framework and gin-based dependency injection.

Ideally, all the developer has to do is create a gin module defining the Activity-Place mapping and the application will be ready. 

Some binding annotations will be required in user-defined modules, but every divergence from the Activity framework will be avoided if possible.
